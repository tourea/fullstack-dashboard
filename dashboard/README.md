#### Prerequisite ####
NPM should installed

#### Installation ####
To install the required modules, run ```npm install```.

#### Start Server ####
To start the server, run ```npm start```.

The above command will start the server in "live reload" mode so that whenever something is changed in the files, we don't need to refresh the browser.
This behavior is defined in package.json in the start field by passing ```--hot```:

 ```"start": "webpack-dev-server --hot"```
